## SDG Alignment  

### SDG #4: Quality Education  
This project addresses **SDG #4** by encouraging students to stay organized, manage deadlines, and prioritize tasks effectively, leading to better educational outcomes.  

**Key Contributions:**  
- Improves time management skills.  
- Fosters productivity and reduces academic stress.  
- Provides an easy-to-use digital platform for task tracking. 

### SDG #8: Decent Work and Economic Growth 
RememBert promotes productivity by allowing individuals to keep track of their tasks contributing to a better work performance.

 





## OOP Principles Applied  

### Abstraction  
- The **Task** class serves as a base class that hides implementation details of specific task types (e.g., `QuizTask`, `ActivityTask`). This ensures that users interact with tasks in a simplified manner without worrying about internal workings.  

### Encapsulation  
- Attributes such as `title`, `dueDate`, `userId`, and `completed` are private in the `Task` class. Getter and setter methods control access to these properties, enforcing data integrity and security.  

### Inheritance  
- Specialized classes (`QuizTask`, `ActivityTask`, etc.) inherit from the `Task` class, reusing its properties and methods while extending functionality to suit specific task types.  

### Polymorphism  
- The `displayInfo()` method is overridden in each subclass, providing tailored behavior depending on the type of task. For example:
  - A `QuizTask` might display details relevant to quizzes, while an `ActivityTask` shows details related to activities.
